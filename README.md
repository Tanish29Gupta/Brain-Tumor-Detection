# Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Network
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images categorized into four classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, no tumor, and pituitary tumor.
