Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Network
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The dataset used for training and testing consists of images categorized into four classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, no tumor, and pituitary tumor.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the training and testing data.
Train the Convolutional Neural Network.
Evaluate the model.
Make predictions on new images.
File Structure
train.py: Contains the code for training the CNN model.
predict.py: Includes functions to make predictions on new images.
data/: Directory containing training and testing data.
models/: Directory to save trained models.
utils/: Utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.
README.md: Project documentation file.
Training
To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Predictions
To make predictions on new images, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path <path_to_image>
Results
After training, the model's performance metrics such as accuracy and loss will be displayed. Additionally, the predictions on new images will be printed along with the corresponding class labels.
